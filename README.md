# RareDx Bench

A rare disease diagnostics benchmark for AI variant interpretation. Results are on the
dashboard at https://benchmarks.aivaportal.com.

## Benchmark files

Run your model on the input file, then score it against the answers, matched by `id`.

### Variant Classification (`data/classification/`)

2,894 ClinGen eRepo variants with expert panel classifications.

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `aiva_bench_input.jsonl` | Input: the variants, with no classifications |
| `erepo_bias_intervar_merged.jsonl` | Answers: eRepo expert classification and criteria, plus BIAS-2015 and InterVar predictions |

### Variant Ranking (`data/ranking/`)

1,396 simulated rare disease patients, each with one causal gene among the candidates.

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `ranking_input.jsonl` | Input: age of onset, positive and negative HPO terms, candidate genes and variants |
| `ranking_prompts.jsonl` | Input: the same cases as a ready-to-send prompt |
| `ranking_answers.jsonl` | Answers: causal gene, labeled distractor genes and phenotypes, categories |
| `ranking_raw.jsonl` | Inputs, prompt and answers together in one record per case |

## Start the dashboard server

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8050 --directory dashboard
```

Then open http://localhost:8050. To rebuild the dashboard after adding results,
run `python3 scripts/update_dashboard.py`; see [CLASSIFICATION_GUIDE.md](CLASSIFICATION_GUIDE.md)
for adding a classification model and [dashboard/README.md](dashboard/README.md) for the page itself.
